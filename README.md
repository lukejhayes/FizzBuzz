# FizzBuzz
Fizzbuzz Algorithm

DIRECTIONS:
Right click on the blank home page and select the imspector tool. Once inside the console, type 'fizzBuzz()'. (
without the '')

Wrote myself a script that prints the numbers 1 to 100 in the console. But for multiples of three, my algorithm prints `Fizz` instead of the number. For multiples of five, the algorithm prints `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints `FizzBuzz`.
